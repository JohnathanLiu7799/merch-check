# USAGE

In order to be able to generalize to all merch stores, the xpaths and css selectors need to be customized according to site.

I personally used windows task manager to automate it using included bat file

pickle file holds previous items from merch site to compare with and find new/discontinued items.

Frontend scraping with selenium, file serialziation with pickle, custom notifications with plyer.

Also shoutout to Mobius Digital for making Outerwilds and Annapurna Interactive for making sick merch for it.

Any questions shoot an email to 17jliu@gmail.com
